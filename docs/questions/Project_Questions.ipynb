    "    * identifying players who are likely to lapse and \n",
    "    * identify key features that are predictive of likelihood to lapse\n",

    "#### What was the definition of lapse?\n",
    "* A key business metric that is used in Zynga is the CURR (current user retention rate), which is defined as a player who logged-in in the past 7 days and during the 7 days prior to last week. \n",
    "* A player is considered lapsed if he / she has logged-in in the past 7 days and does not login in any of the next 7 days\n",
